<h5 id="description">Description</h5>
<p>The theatre is getting popular, and the customers started complaining that it's not practical that the program stops after buying one ticket. Let's add a menu that will allow them to buy tickets and display the current state of the seating arrangement when needed.</p>
<h5 id="objectives">Objectives</h5>
<p>At the start, your program should read two positive integer numbers that represent the number of rows and seats in each row. Then, it should print a menu with the following three items:</p>
<ul>
<li><code class="java">Show the seats</code> should print the current seating arrangement. The empty seats should be marked with an <code class="java">S</code> symbol, and taken seats are marked with a <code class="java">B</code> symbol.</li>
<li><code class="java">Buy a ticket</code> should read the seat coordinates from the input and print the ticket price like in the previous stage. After that, the chosen seat should be marked with a <code class="java">B</code> when the item <code class="java">Show the seats</code> is called.</li>
<li><code class="java">Exit</code> should stop the program.</li>
</ul>
<p></p><div class="alert alert-primary">When users select the <code class="java">"Exit"</code> option from the menu, your program should terminate execution and stop; the idiomatic way in Go to control program execution is using the <code class="java">return</code> statement within a loop or function to end/stop the loop or exit the function.

<p>In less common scenarios where your program needs to terminate immediately from any point, you can use the <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/os#Exit" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><code class="java">os.Exit()</code> function</a>. However, you should only use this approach sparingly:</p>
<ul>
<li>For a normal exit, such as when the program has finished successfully, use <code class="java">os.Exit(0)</code>.</li>
<li>To signal an abnormal termination due to errors or any other issues in the program, you can use <code class="java">os.Exit(1)</code>.</li></ul></div>
<h5 id="example">Example</h5>
<p>The greater-than symbol followed by a space (<code class="java">&gt; </code>) represents the user input. Note that it's not part of the input.</p>
