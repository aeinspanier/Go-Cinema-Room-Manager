<h5 id="description">Description</h5>
<p>When choosing a ticket, you are guided not only by your space preference but also by your finances. Let's implement the opportunity to check the ticket price and display the single reserved seat.</p>
<h5 id="objectives">Objectives</h5>
<p>First, scan two positive integer numbers representing the number of rows and the number of seats in each row. Use these numbers to print the initial seating arrangement like in the previous stage.</p>
<p>Next, prompt the user to enter a row number and a seat number within that row; these two integers will represent the seat coordinates. According to these coordinates, the program should then calculate and print the ticket price using the following rules:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the total number of seats in the screen room is not more than 60, then the price of each ticket is 10 dollars.</li>
<li>In a larger room, the tickets are 10 dollars for the front half of the rows and 8 dollars for the back half. Please note that the number of rows can be odd, for example, 9 rows. In this case, the first half is the first 4 rows, and the second half is the last 5 rows.</li>
</ul>
<p>After printing the ticket price, the program should update the seating arrangement by marking the chosen seat with the symbol <code class="java">B</code>. Finally, the program should print the final seating arrangement reflecting the newly reserved seat and finish/stop execution after this step.</p>
<p>Note that in this project, the number of rows and seats will NOT be greater than 9.</p>
<h5 id="examples">Examples</h5>
<p>The greater-than symbol followed by a space (<code class="java">&gt; </code>) represents the user input. Note that it's not part of the input.</p>
